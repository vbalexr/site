Hi!

Before diving into the technical topics, I want to share a bit about myself and what drives me every day.

I’m **Alex Vargas**, and while my journey in technology has been a big part of my life, my heart belongs to my family. They are my everything, and every decision I make is with them in mind.

## My Journey

I studied Computer Science a long time ago, though I never completed my degree. Life took me down a different path, and while it wasn’t what I had planned, I wouldn’t change a thing. Along the way, I worked in fabrication labs, helped startups with code and prototypes, and spent countless hours tinkering with microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP8266, and STM chips.

Later, I found myself working for a creative company developing video games with custom-made controllers. My experience with microcontrollers became invaluable, and I loved the blend of technology and creativity.

## My Family, My World

Then, life gave me the greatest gift of all: my family. I met an incredible woman who became my wife, my partner, and my best friend. Together, we’ve built a life filled with love, laughter, and joy. And then came our son—a little human who has completely changed our world. He’s our everything, and watching him grow is the greatest privilege of my life.

Every moment I spend with them is precious. Whether it’s playing outside, touching grass, or just being together, those are the moments that truly matter. My weekends are dedicated to them, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

## Discovering Homelabs

During the pandemic, like many others, I faced challenges. I lost my job and spent a long time unemployed at home. It was a tough period, but it also gave me the opportunity to discover homelabbing. I wanted to run some services at home but didn’t want to spend much money. Electricity is affordable where we live, so I started with an old laptop and a Raspberry Pi 4 I had lying around.

My first services were [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). These small projects made a huge impact on our daily lives, simplifying things like managing shopping lists and automating notifications for tasks like garbage collection. Eventually, I got a new job, and with time, I started adding smart switches, IP cameras, and sensors to our home.

## Where I Am Now

Today, I work for a wonderful company as a **Software Engineer** in a **Quality Engineering team**. It’s a full-time job that I enjoy, but my weekends are sacred—they’re for my family. Whether we’re playing outside, exploring new places, or just spending time together, those moments are what fuel me.

But as a tech enthusiast, I sacrifice time at night to play with new tools, experiment, and develop projects. It’s my way of staying connected to my passion for technology while balancing my responsibilities.

This blog and my YouTube channel are my way of documenting my journey, sharing what I’ve learned, and connecting with others who share similar passions. I aim to share tips, tricks, and ideas that might inspire or help others in their own projects.
