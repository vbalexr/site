# Storage Configuration

Storage is a critical component of any cluster, as it ensures data availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance. In this document, I’ll outline the storage configuration for my home lab, the options I considered, and the final decision that aligns with my goals.

---

## Initial Plan

Each node in the cluster will be equipped with the following storage configuration:
- **1 NVMe SSD (128GB)**: Dedicated for the operating system.
- **2 NVMe SSDs (2TB each)**: Used for data storage.

The initial idea was to configure the storage as follows:
1. Use the **128GB NVMe SSD** on each node exclusively for the operating system.
2. Configure the **2TB NVMe SSDs** on each node as a **ZFS mirror** to provide redundancy at the node level.
3. Use **ZFS over TCP** to synchronize data across nodes, ensuring redundancy across the cluster.

### Challenges with the Initial Plan:
- **Storage Efficiency**: Using ZFS mirrors on each node and synchronizing data across nodes would reduce the total usable storage significantly. From a raw capacity of **12TB** (6 x 2TB), only **2TB** of usable storage would remain due to redundancy requirements. This is a significant loss of capacity.
- **Complexity**: Managing ZFS over TCP adds additional complexity to the setup, especially when integrating with Kubernetes.
- **Scalability**: The setup would be difficult to scale as the cluster grows, requiring careful management of ZFS pools and synchronization.

## Exploring Alternatives

To address the challenges of the initial plan, I explored other storage configurations that could provide redundancy, scalability, and better integration with Kubernetes.

### Option 1: ZFS with Striped Configuration
- **Description**: Instead of using ZFS mirrors, configure the 2TB NVMe SSDs in a striped configuration (RAID 0) to maximize usable storage.
- **Advantages**:
  - More usable storage, providing the full **6TB** of usable capacity.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - No redundancy at the node level. If a single SSD fails, all data on that node is lost.
  - Difficult to scale as the cluster grows, requiring careful management of ZFS pools and synchronization.

### Option 2: Longhorn
- **Description**: Use [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/), a lightweight and robust distributed block storage solution designed for Kubernetes.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Kubernetes Integration**: Longhorn is designed to work seamlessly with Kubernetes, simplifying storage management.
  - **Redundancy**: Provides built-in redundancy by replicating data across multiple nodes.
  - **Remote Backups**: Supports remote backups, ensuring data is protected even in the event of a catastrophic failure.
  - **Scalability**: Easily scales as the cluster grows, with minimal manual intervention.
  - **Adaptability**: Data replication can be configured for each container volume, allowing fine-grained control over redundancy.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Adds a layer of abstraction, which may introduce some performance overhead compared to direct ZFS usage.
  - Requires learning and understanding Longhorn’s architecture and best practices.

## Final Decision: Longhorn

After evaluating the options, I decided to use **Longhorn** as the storage solution for my home lab. Here’s why:

1. **Seamless Kubernetes Integration**: Longhorn is purpose-built for Kubernetes, making it easy to manage storage directly within the Kubernetes ecosystem.
2. **Redundancy Across Nodes**: Longhorn replicates data across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance without relying on ZFS over TCP.
3. **Efficient Use of Storage**: By avoiding ZFS mirrors, I can utilize more of the raw storage capacity while still maintaining redundancy at the cluster level.
4. **Simplified Backups**: Longhorn’s built-in support for remote backups ensures that data is protected and recoverable in case of failure.
5. **Scalability**: Longhorn’s architecture allows the storage system to grow with the cluster, making it a future-proof solution.
6. **Adaptability**: Longhorn allows per-volume replication policies, enabling fine-tuned redundancy for specific workloads.

# Summary

The storage configuration for the home lab is designed to balance redundancy, scalability, and integration with Kubernetes. By using Longhorn, I can simplify storage management while ensuring data availability and fault tolerance.

### Key Benefits of the Final Configuration:
- **Redundancy**: Data is replicated across nodes, ensuring high availability.
- **Adaptability**: Data replication can be configured for each container volume, providing flexibility for different workloads.
- **Kubernetes Native**: Longhorn integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, simplifying storage operations.
- **Scalability**: The storage system can grow with the cluster, supporting future expansion.
- **Efficient Use of Resources**: Maximizes usable storage capacity while maintaining redundancy.
- **Backup Support**: Built-in remote backup capabilities provide additional data protection.

This configuration ensures that the home lab’s storage system is reliable, efficient, and aligned with the overall goals of the cluster.
