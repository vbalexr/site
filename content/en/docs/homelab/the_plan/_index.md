After selecting the hardware, I’ve developed a comprehensive plan for setting up the cluster, focusing on efficient hardware utilization and a robust network configuration.

# Hardware

To build the cluster, I purchased three [Minisforum MS-01](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ms-01) MiniPCs. These devices offer an excellent combination of performance, expandability, and energy efficiency. 

## Network

- **2 USB4 Ports**: Supporting 20Gbps Thunderbolt Ethernet for high-speed data transfer.
- **2 10Gb SFP+ Ports**: High-speed fiber connectivity, ideal for low-latency communication. I’ll be using [DAC cables](https://www.servethehome.com/what-is-a-direct-attach-copper-dac-cable/) for these connections.
- **2 2.5Gb RJ45 Ports**: Standard Ethernet ports for general networking and external communication.

## Storage
- 3 M2 NVMe slots
- Or 1 U.2 NVMe + 2 M2 NVMe
- Addicional PCIe4
