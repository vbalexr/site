Choosing the right software stack was a critical part of the process. This document outlines the options I considered, their pros and cons, and the final decision that aligns with my goals for the home lab.

# Options Considered

## Bare Metal

Managing systems directly on bare metal was one of the first options I considered. This approach involves running workloads directly on the hardware without any virtualization or containerization layers.

### **Pros**:
- **Simplicity**: No additional layers of abstraction, making it straightforward to set up.
- **Familiarity**: I have prior experience managing bare-metal systems, so it would be easy to get started.

### **Cons**:
- **Manual Management**: Requires constant manual intervention for updates, configuration, and maintenance, which can be time-consuming.
- **Lack of Scalability**: Not efficient for modern workloads that require dynamic scaling.
- **No Automation**: Difficult to automate, making it unsuitable for a high-availability setup.

### **Decision**:  
**Rejected.** While bare metal is simple and familiar, it doesn’t align with my goals of automation, scalability, and high availability.

## Docker

Using Docker containers with Ansible for automation was another option I explored. Docker is a widely used containerization platform that simplifies application deployment by packaging applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers.

### **Pros**:
- **Widely Used**: Docker is a well-documented and widely adopted technology, making it easy to find resources and community support.
- **Lightweight**: Containers are efficient and ideal for modern application deployment.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to set up and manage for single-node environments.

### **Cons**:
- **Limited High Availability**: Docker alone doesn’t provide built-in support for high availability across multiple nodes.
- **Workload Balancing**: Managing distributed systems and balancing workloads across nodes can be challenging without additional tools.

### **Decision**:  
**Rejected.** Docker is excellent for single-node setups but falls short when it comes to meeting my high-availability requirements.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes emerged as the most promising option, despite its complexity. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### **Pros**:
- **High Availability**: Built-in support for high availability and fault tolerance ensures workloads remain operational even during node failures.
- **Load Balancing and Scaling**: Automatically balances workloads and scales applications based on demand.
- **Robust Ecosystem**: A rich ecosystem of tools and extensions for managing containerized applications.
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted in the industry, ensuring long-term support, community resources, and compatibility with modern tools.

### **Cons**:
- **Complex Deployment**: Initial setup can be challenging and requires a steep learning curve.
- **Management Overhead**: Managing Kubernetes clusters involves understanding new concepts, tools, and best practices.

### **Decision**:  
**Selected.** Kubernetes provides the features I need for a high-availability cluster, and I’m willing to invest the time to learn and set it up.

# Final Decision: Kubernetes with Talos OS

After deciding on Kubernetes, I looked for ways to simplify its deployment and management. That’s when I discovered [Talos OS](https://www.talos.dev/), a modern operating system designed specifically for Kubernetes.

### **Why Talos OS?**
- **Minimal and Secure**: Talos OS abstracts away the underlying operating system, providing a minimal and secure environment tailored for Kubernetes.
- **Focus on Kubernetes**: Allows me to concentrate entirely on Kubernetes without worrying about managing the OS.
- **Production-Ready**: Used in production by many organizations, ensuring stability and reliability.
- **Strong Community**: Backed by an active community and supported by major Kubernetes projects, ensuring compatibility and long-term support.

By using Talos OS, I can avoid the complexities of managing a traditional operating system and focus on building and running my cluster efficiently.

# Summary

After evaluating multiple options, I chose Kubernetes as the core platform for my home lab due to its robust features for high availability, scalability, and workload management. To simplify deployment and management, I paired Kubernetes with Talos OS, a purpose-built operating system for Kubernetes clusters.

This combination provides:
- **High Availability**: Ensures workloads remain operational even during node failures.
- **Simplified Management**: Talos OS eliminates the need to manage a traditional operating system.
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes supports dynamic scaling to meet changing demands.
- **Future-Proofing**: Both Kubernetes and Talos OS are widely adopted and supported, ensuring long-term viability.

With this software stack, I can build a reliable, scalable, and efficient home lab that meets my goals for experimentation and personal projects.
