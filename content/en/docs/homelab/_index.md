# Goals and Requirements

These are the key requirements and goals I have for my home lab.  
**Note:** This is not my first cluster. I already have enterprise-grade clusters for other purposes. This cluster is specifically for my home and side projects that I enjoy running.

## Low Power Consumption

One of the primary goals is to minimize electricity usage. Running a cluster 24/7 can lead to significant energy costs, especially in a home environment. By choosing energy-efficient hardware, I can ensure that the cluster operates continuously without causing a noticeable increase in electricity bills. This also aligns with sustainability goals and reduces the environmental impact of running a home lab.

## Redundant/Failover Connectivity

Network reliability is critical for any cluster. The system must be resilient to network failures, ensuring that if a single cable or port fails, the cluster remains operational. Redundancy is achieved by using multiple network interfaces and paths, so at least one link remains active at all times. This ensures uninterrupted communication between nodes and external systems.

## High Availability

High availability is a cornerstone of this setup. The cluster must be capable of handling node failures, maintenance, or upgrades without disrupting workloads. This is achieved through distributed systems and orchestration tools that ensure workloads are automatically redistributed to healthy nodes, maintaining uptime and reliability.

## High-Speed Network and Distributed Storage

To support high availability, the cluster requires a high-speed network for efficient communication between nodes. Additionally, a distributed storage system is essential for synchronizing data across nodes. This ensures that data is always accessible, even if one node goes offline. A high-speed network minimizes latency and maximizes throughput, which is critical for data-intensive operations.

## Simple Deployment and Management

Managing the cluster should be straightforward and efficient. By adopting GitOps principles, I can store the entire configuration in a Git repository. This approach provides version control, easy replication, and a clear history of changes. It also simplifies backups and disaster recovery, as the entire setup can be redeployed from the repository.
