This page provides an overview of some key networking and storage concepts that are foundational to the decisions made for the home lab setup. Understanding these concepts will help clarify the reasoning behind the chosen configurations.

# Network

As I aim to minimize equipment to reduce points of failure and costs, I decided to use a **3-node cluster configuration** with a **Ring Network Topology** well it end been a **Mesh Network Topology**. This approach balances simplicity, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Ring Network Topology

A **Ring Network Topology** is a configuration where each device (or node) is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a closed circular data path. In this setup, with three nodes, data travels directly from one node to another in a circular manner.

### Key Characteristics:
- **No Central Hub**: Unlike star or hub-and-spoke topologies, there is no central point of failure. Each node is equally important in the network.
- **Redundancy**: Since each node has two links, if one link fails, packets can still travel through the neighboring node. This ensures continued communication and fault tolerance.
- **Efficiency**: The circular data path minimizes the number of hops required for communication between nodes, reducing latency.

### Advantages:
- **Cost-Effective**: Requires fewer cables and no central switch or hub, reducing hardware costs.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The dual-link setup ensures that the network remains operational even if one link/node fails.

### Disadvantages:
- **Limited Scalability**: Adding more nodes increases the complexity of the ring and may introduce latency.

## Link Aggregation (LAGG)

**Link Aggregation (LAGG)** is the process of combining multiple network connections in parallel to increase throughput and provide redundancy. This is particularly useful in scenarios where high availability and fault tolerance are required.

> *Note: This is a simplified explanation. There are multiple ways to implement link aggregation, each with unique characteristics and trade-offs. For a deeper dive, check out this video from [Lawrence Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Dpuu_gBmo), where they explain LAGG in the context of TrueNAS.*

### How It Works:
- **Parallel Connections**: Multiple physical network links are combined into a single logical link.
- **Increased Throughput**: While a single connection cannot exceed the bandwidth of an individual link, multiple connections can utilize the combined bandwidth of all links.
- **Redundancy**: If one physical link fails, the remaining links continue to provide connectivity, ensuring fault tolerance.

### Key Benefits:
1. **Improved Performance**: By distributing traffic across multiple links, LAGG can handle higher aggregate bandwidth, making it ideal for data-intensive operations.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Even if one or more links fail, the network remains operational as long as at least one link is active.
3. **Load Balancing**: Traffic can be distributed across the available links, optimizing resource utilization.

### Limitations:
- **Single Connection Bandwidth**: A single connection is still limited to the bandwidth of one physical link. For example, if you have two 1Gbps links, a single connection will only utilize 1Gbps, but multiple connections can utilize up to 2Gbps in total.
- **Switch Support**: LAGG often requires support from the network switch, such as **Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)**, to manage the aggregated links effectively.

# Storage

Storage is a critical component of any cluster, as it ensures data availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance. In my home lab, I’ve chosen to focus on two key storage technologies: **RAID** and **ZFS**.

## RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

RAID is a technology that combines multiple physical disks into a single logical unit to improve performance, redundancy, or both. There are two primary types of RAID implementations:

### 1. Hardware RAID
- **Description**: Managed by a dedicated RAID controller, either as a standalone card or integrated into the motherboard.
- **Advantages**:
  - Offloads processing from the CPU, improving overall system performance.
  - Often includes battery-backed cache for improved write performance and data protection during power outages.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Expensive compared to software RAID.
  - Limited flexibility, as the RAID configuration is tied to the specific hardware controller.

### 2. Software RAID
- **Description**: Managed by the operating system or specialized software (e.g., Linux MDADM).
- **Advantages**:
  - Cost-effective, as it doesn’t require additional hardware.
  - More flexible and portable, as the RAID configuration is stored on the disks themselves.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Relies on the CPU for processing, which may impact performance under heavy workloads.

### Common RAID Levels:
- **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**: Provides redundancy by duplicating data across two disks. If one disk fails, the other continues to operate.
- **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)**: Balances performance and redundancy by distributing parity information across all disks. Requires at least three disks.
- **RAID 10 (Striping + Mirroring)**: Combines the benefits of RAID 1 and RAID 0, offering high performance and redundancy. Requires at least four disks.

## ZFS (Zettabyte File System)

ZFS is a modern file system and volume manager that provides advanced features for data integrity, scalability, and performance. It is particularly well-suited for home labs due to its robust fault tolerance and flexibility.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Integrity**: ZFS uses checksums to detect and correct data corruption, ensuring that your data remains consistent and reliable.
2. **Snapshots and Clones**: Allows you to create point-in-time snapshots of your data, which can be used for backups or testing.
3. **Compression**: Built-in compression reduces storage requirements and improves performance by reducing the amount of data written to disk.
4. **RAID-Z**: A ZFS-specific implementation of RAID that eliminates the write hole issue found in traditional RAID setups.

### Advantages:
- **Scalability**: Supports petabytes of storage and thousands of snapshots.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically detects and repairs data corruption.
- **Flexibility**: Combines file system and volume management into a single solution.
