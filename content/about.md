# About Me

Hi, I’m **Alex Vargas**, a tech enthusiast passionate about **homelabs**, **software development**, **networking**, and **Kubernetes**. This blog and my YouTube channel are dedicated to documenting and sharing my journey, projects, and insights in the world of technology.

The main goal of this site and the YouTube channel is to document everything I’m building and learning. As a husband and father, I don’t always have a lot of time, which means I often start projects, pause for long periods, and then come back to them. This platform helps me keep track of my progress and serves as a resource for others who might benefit from my experiences.

Whether you’re setting up your first homelab, diving into networking, or exploring the latest in software development, you’ll find content here to inspire and guide you.
